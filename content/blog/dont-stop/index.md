In the Bento reform project , we　invited Biteology (bit eology), which　specializes in the use of seasonal　ingredients, to Taiwan's agricultural　production base: Yunlin. They　searched for NG exceptional products　in the field and used limited　ingredients to bring out their ultimate 
creativity. However, it is　impossible to foresee the purchase　of ingr edients in adv ance, and it
also poses a certain degree of difficulty for bit elearning.
