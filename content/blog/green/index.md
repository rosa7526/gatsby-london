For children from 18 months to2 years,
children may not stuck in the stroller 
anymore,it is important that exercis-
ing becomes their hobby,and most of
all,it is more about play balance and
coordination. We wanted to make a 
product that would combine the stroller
and push bike,that we wanted to make
a product that would grow with the child.
